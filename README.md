# Colombian Public Procurement Data ETL & AI Platform

This repository is dedicated to the extraction, transformation, and analysis of Colombian public procurement data. Our goal is to build a robust foundation for advanced AI-driven insights, including red flag detection, contextual engineering, and agentic systems for transparency and accountability.

## Contents

- **Data Download & ETL:** Scripts for automated retrieval and normalization of procurement data from official sources ([secop_download.py](secop_download.py)).
- **Data Exploration:** Tools for initial analysis and visualization ([explore_json_data.py](explore_json_data.py)).
- **Sample Data:** Real procurement records in JSON format for testing and development ([secop_download_09_19_2025.json](secop_download_09_19_2025.json), [secop_download_10_01_2025.json](secop_download_10_01_2025.json)).
- **Requirements:** Python dependencies for reproducible environments ([requirements.txt](requirements.txt)).
- **Documentation:** This README and license ([LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## What Can Be Done With Public Procurement Data?

- **Transparency & Oversight:** Track spending, contract awards, and supplier relationships.
- **Red Flag Detection:** Identify anomalies, patterns of risk, and potential corruption using AI/GenAI.
- **Contextual Analysis:** Integrate external data (e.g., news, audits) for richer insights.
- **Prompt Engineering & RAG:** Enable advanced querying and retrieval-augmented generation for investigative journalism, civil society, and government oversight.
- **Agentic AI Systems:** Develop autonomous agents to monitor, report, and recommend actions on suspicious procurement activities.

## Vision (2025–2027)

By leveraging modern AI and data engineering, this project aims to deliver:

- **Automated Red Flag Alerts:** Real-time detection of irregularities in procurement processes.
- **Conversational Analytics:** Natural language interfaces for querying and explaining procurement data.
- **Contextual Intelligence:** Cross-referencing contracts with external sources for deeper risk assessment.
- **Open Platform:** Tools and APIs for journalists, watchdogs, and public officials to promote transparency and accountability.
